Currently extracts a false CNF from a qrc proof.
Still needs a makefile as I made this with visual studio
Needs testing, check that output CNFs are indeed false. The other check is that strategies are added correctly, we do this with QRAT
As far as I know the program runs and gets an answer. I made this public to make it easier for me and others to test and finalise.
